## Abstract
Over the last decade, Netflix has cemented its position as a leading streaming media provider. To maintain its dominance, Netflix has commissioned a one-million-dollar prize in 2009 for the code that improved rating predictions for previously collected real-life customer. Our team has been tasked with the same task for two months. As of the end of the first month, we successfully read and visualized the original dataset provided by Netflix and identified strategies to proceed with the project. Some of these strategies included K-means clustering and Pearsonsâ€™ R correlation. Approaching the conclusion of our project, we were able to supplement about 60% of the movie titles with IMDB online database. In addition, we included some time-series analysis of movie and user trends. This paper has been submitted as part of a class entitled Big Data Analytics (IE:4172) on December 7, 2018.
